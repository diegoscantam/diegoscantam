### Hi there!
My name is Diego Scantamburlo and I'm a physics student originally from Trento, Italy.
- 🎓 Bachelor physics student at the [University of Trento, Italy](https://www.unitn.it/)
- ⚛️ Currently doing an internship in quantum computing at [TIFPA (Trento Institute for Fundamental Physics and Applications)](https://www.tifpa.infn.it/) research centre
- 🌍 Erasmus program at the [University of Oslo, Norway](https://www.uio.no/english/). In my pinned repositories you can also find some cool computational physics simulations I worked on there.
